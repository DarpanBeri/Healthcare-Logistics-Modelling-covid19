Notes on the MSRI video

Video Link: https://youtu.be/MZ957qhzcjI

General Notes: 

* Look at timestamp 51:35 which talks about the need to model healthcare needs.

* Look at timestamp 56:50 which talks about reading on healthcare needs and paper he could suggest.

* Look into agent based modelling.

Further Research:

* Imperial Collenge London Model. Report 12.

"... our mitigated scenarios lead to peak demand for critical care beds in a typical low-income setting outstripping supply by a factor of 25... "

Takeaways:

• The aim of the model should not be to give scientific predictions. They should help with providing key insights that may not be visible using commonsense - Chris Whitty, CMO England, 2015

• Models cannot accurately predict the peak. Rnot is a variable.

• Models tend to be too simplistic.

• Models do tell us about where we are heading and what we need to do.

• Imperial College model is a major influential model.

• Vaccine timeline is 12-18 months, where 12 months is super optimistic. Thus there will be multiple waves and those waves will affect the logistics. The pandemic timeline is 1-2 years (based off models).

• It is not established that people can get reinfected or not. If so, the logistic requirements may fall short.

• It is better to have 4 or 5 modelling groups giving somewhat dissenting advice than to have 1 group giving a decisive advice.
