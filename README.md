# Healthcare Logistics Modelling for covid19 crisis
A Project to try to model healthcare's logistical needs due to covid19 crisis.

### Inspired and Motivated by:

- [Simulating an Epidemic](https://youtu.be/gxAaO2rsdIs) created by 3Blue1Brown on Youtube
- [COVID-19: The Exponential Power of Now - With Prof. Nicholas Jewell](https://youtu.be/MZ957qhzcjI) uploaded by 
Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) on Youtube
- [Current covid19 statistics](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data)

### Components:

#### - Research:
		- The aim is to figure out a reliable modelling methodology.
		- Currently ongoing. Look at plans to see details.

#### - Modelling:
		- Model to be in Python for easier visualization.
		- Planned to start after research is satisfactorily enough to get some output.

### Plan:
1. Setup a repository where our research is publicly available
2. Identify what needs to be researched and how to research
3. Research the topics and aggregate results to create a proposal on modelling methodology
4. Contact experts to possibly discuss the methodology
5. Create the model
